# FriendFinder
**Match with a friend**

Friend Finder is a personality quiz that matches you with someone who has similar answers as you!

## Motivation

This app is designed to create connections between like-minded individuals on the answers of the questions provided.

## How to use?

The homepage is simple, it asks you for your name as well as a link to a hosted picture of your choosing(preferably your face). Clicking on the "Let's Get Started" button brings you to the survey page where you are faced with ten questions. Using the drop down menus to choose how much you agree or disagree with the questions gives you a score that is referenced to the other users in the database. Clicking "Find Me A Friend" will grant you a friend to whom you had the most similar answers. In the event you did not answer all the questions, you will be prompted with an alert telling you that you have questions unanswered.
